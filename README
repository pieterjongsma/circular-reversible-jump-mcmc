# DATA ARCHIVE

Version of R and packages can be found in `VERSIONS` file.

## Simulations
### Generate simulation scenario's

The simulation scenarios have been generated via a script. This script is called through

    ./run_generate_scenarios.R
    
Note that the scenarios include random seeds and running this script will generate different seeds every time. For this reason, the scenarios/seeds used in the published material have been included in the data archive.

### Execute simulation scenario's

    ./run_evaluate_scenarios.R scenarios/uniform.RData results/uniform 1
    ./run_evaluate_scenarios.R scenarios/single_component.RData results/uniform 1
    ./run_evaluate_scenarios.R scenarios/two_components.RData results/uniform 1
    ./run_evaluate_scenarios.R scenarios/two_components_opposite.RData results/uniform 1
    ./run_evaluate_scenarios.R scenarios/three_components.RData results/uniform 1

### Obtain summary information

After executing the simulation scenarios, summaries can be obtained by executing

    ./run_summarize_results.R
    
Which will output the summaries in the terminal. To dump the results in a file, use something like

    ./run_summarize_results.R > results.txt
    
### Visualize convergence

Convergence plots are rendered into `./figures` by running

    ./run_visualize_convergence.R
   
    
## 22tracks data
### Visualize genres

Kernel density estimates for genres are rendered into `./figures` by running

    ./run_visualize_plays.R
    
### Evaluate plays

The results in the paper can be reproduced by running

    ./run_evaluate_plays.R
